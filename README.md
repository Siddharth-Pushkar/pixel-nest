# pixel-nest
PixelNest is a full-stack image gallery built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to upload, view, edit, and delete images with captions, locations, and dates. The images are displayed in a Pinterest-style bento grid, with hover effects to reveal captions and a modal popup for enlarged viewing.
